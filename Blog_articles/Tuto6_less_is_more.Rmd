## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Problem

Last year I asked twitter for a solution for identifying packages that are no longer needed in a script.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a way in <a href="https://twitter.com/rstudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rstudio</a> to know which packages are not needed anymore to run a script?<br>I typically install &amp; load many packages when I&#39;m trying out analyses, and sometimes forget why they&#39;re made for initially ðŸ˜¶... Alternatively: how do you manage this issue? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a></p>&mdash; Rosalie Bruel (@RosalieBruel) <a href="https://twitter.com/RosalieBruel/status/998558472533938176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


User @jmcphers recommended <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/packrat"> *packrat*</a>, which I used for one of my project. *packrat* is great to keep track of the package version needed to run a script, but I don't like that it creates a copy of each package: it means I had to re-download all the packages needed for this specific project. It is just too much for my needs.


I re-thought about this issue today, and realized there might be another easy solution.


I wrote the function *lessismore()* to hopefully tackle this. I don't have time to package it, but you can load it using the code below:

```source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosalieb/miscellaneous/master/R/lessismore.R")```


## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Rapid overview

The function require the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sos/index.html">*sos*</a>.

I edited the code from Nicholas Cooper's package <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/NCmisc/">NCmisc</a>. He has a lot of great function in there. I didn't reuse his function _"list.functions.in.file()"_ because I wanted to keep the information on how many times each function was used + his code does not work with .Rmd, so I had to edit that anyway.

For each function that was not associated to a package, I conducted a second search with sos::findFn(), that uses <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.6.1/topics/RSiteSearch">Rsitesearch</a> for matches in vignettes, help pages, or task views. This one takes longer, so that's why I did not use that function systematically (and first went through the option coded in base R).

_lessismore()_ will also return any function that was not matched. It might be because some of the code was uncorrectly identified as functions though.

Arguments of the function are: <br>

Arguments   | Description                    | Example                
------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------- 
packages    | year(plktn\$VisitDate[1])      | .packages()
path2file   | path to file. Extensions can be .R or .Rmd. If .Rmd, will extract the code from the chunks using the _knitr_ library | "my_wd/file.R" / "my_wd/file.Rmd"    
plot_output | whether you want to visualize a plot showing the most used functions. If TRUE, will also require _ggplot2_ and _plotly_  | FALSE 
thresh      | threshold, for packages that may be using the same names than really frequent functions | 2         

I added the threshold argument (*thresh*) at the last minute. I noticed that some functions are used in so many packages that the function becomes not useful. For example, *plot()* is used in the packages raster, sp, changepoint, graphics, and in base R. I'm not sure this "threshold" solves all the problem, but it might help a bit.

##  `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Example

I tried the script on a R markdown file I am currently working on. Here, I am trying to see whether all the packages I have loaded for this session (.packages()) are needed in the script which pathname is "R/EwE_model_param_LakeChamplain.Rmd", and I want to plot which are the functions I used the most (plot_output = T).

```tmtp <- lessismore(packages = .packages(), 
                ath2file = "R/EwE_model_param_LakeChamplain.Rmd", 
                lot_output = T)`
```

Here is the result: <br>

<img src="images/Tuto6/Tuto6_1.png" style="width:100%; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px" align="center">

I found that 14 packages are loaded and but not used in this script. I am using some of these on other scripts I worked on today, but I don't need *readtext* for example (I loaded it as I was writing the _lessismore()_ function).

However, I am using FSAdata! I call at some point the dataset ```FSAdata::TroutperchLM1```. The function does not work for objects which token is different from "SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL". If I or someone else ever want to update the function, that could be an aspect to improve.

## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Summing up

Eventually, instead of looking at all packages I have loaded (with .packages()), I should use a vector of the packages I load at the beginning of my Rmarkdown.

Bonus, you can have a look at the most-used functions in your script:

```{r plot fun, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summ_fun <- read.delim("Data/Tuto6_summ_fn.txt")
require("ggplot2")
require("plotly")
summ_fun$name <- rownames(summ_fun)
summ_fun$index <- 1:nrow(summ_fun)
summ_fun <- summ_fun[order(summ_fun$count, decreasing = T),]
p <- ggplot(summ_fun, aes(index,count, label=summ_fun$name)) + geom_point() + geom_line() +
            theme_bw() + labs(x="Index", y="Count", title="Occurence of each function in the script \n(Hoover to see name of the functions)")
ggplotly(p)
```


My most-used function is _c()_, used to create vectors --- nothing fancy here ðŸ˜’.


Let me know if you end up using the function, if it's working or not, and if you have ideas to make the function more efficient!


<script>
window.onscroll = function() {myFunction()};

var header = document.getElementById("myHeader");
var sticky = header.offsetTop;

function myFunction() {
  if (window.pageYOffset > sticky) {
    header.classList.add("sticky");
  } else {
    header.classList.remove("sticky");
  }
}
</script>
