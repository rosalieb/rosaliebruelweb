## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Problem

I appreciate the functionality in RStudio that keeps in memory (.RDataTemp files) objects created at previous steps, even when closing RStudio. I find this functionality useful when I have a script that takes a while to run, for which the output is useful but not necessarily *that* useful that I want to permanently save it to a local file.

However, on occasion, I have scripts I need to run once and that's it. At the end of said script, I would like to be able to remove from the environment any object that was created by the script. In other words, I would like to be able to use rm(), but instead of doing it for the whole environment (\`ls()\`), I would like to do it for the environment of a specific script.

I wrote the function *get.objects.from.script()* to tackle this. You can load the function using the code below:

```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
#remotes::install_github("rlesur/klippy")
klippy::klippy('')
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, class.source='klippy'}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosalieb/miscellaneous/master/R/get.objects.from.script.R")
```

## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Easy alternatives and why they did not fit my needs

### `r titlenb`.1. Alternative 1: list objects before and after running the script

One easy way could be to list the files in the environment at the beginning of a script, and list the files after having ran the script, and do the differential of objects. For example, see the script below:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, class.source='klippy'}
# Start script
initial_objects <- ls()

# Create a bunch of objects
temp <- LETTERS[1:3]
data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1)
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

# Remove only the objects that were created since initial_objects was last run
# 1. See what is returned: should include "initial_objects" "temp" "data" "p1"  
ls()[!ls() %in% initial_objects]
# 2. Remove these objects
rm(list = ls()[!ls() %in% initial_objects])
```

However, there are at least three scenarios I can think of in which the listed files (in `initial_objects`) wouldn't be the right ones:

1.  If by mistake I forgot to run the first line \`initial_objects \<- ls()\`, it will be "too late" to go back, and I will end up having to list the objects manually.

2.  A variant: If by mistake I run the first line multiple times, after running the script a first time (for example, if I run everything above a certain line, or if I run "all chunks above" in a .Rmd).

3.  If there was already an element in the environment with the same name as an object created within the script. I frequently use some names across scripts, for objects I will not keep. For example, I use "temp" for a temporary object, "p1" for a plot, "out" for an output object that I would populate within a loop, etc. If I already have an object "temp" in the environment, it won't be removed using the method above. However, it is not something I need to keep per my requirements stated in the section "problem".

### `r titlenb`.2. Alternative 2: run the script in its own environment  

A second option would be to run the script in its own environment, which is possible when sourcing a file. 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, class.source='klippy'}
my_env <- new.env()  
source("myscript.R", my_env)  
rm(my_env)  
```

However, this would only work for a script I do not need to run line by line to visualize the output. This solution does not fit my exact needs either.

## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. A rapid overview of the function get.objects.from.script()

The function is pretty simple, and follows three steps:

1.  Screening through the current script (although you could also set the path to another script if you want). This part relies on the function `getParseData()` from the library *utils*.

2.  Keep only the objects (token = "SYMBOL").

3.  Find and return which objects are in the Global Environment.

The function returns all the objects created in the script. You can then run `rm()`, except that instead of removing everything from the environment (`rm(list = ls())`), you can choose to remove only the objects created within the current script:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, class.source='klippy'}
rm(list = get.objects.from.script())
```


Arguments of the function are: <br>

| Arguments | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example                           |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| path2file | path to file. Extensions can be .R or .Rmd. If .Rmd, will extract the code from the chunks using the *knitr* library                                                                                   | "my_wd/file.R" / "my_wd/file.Rmd" |
| exception | any objects that you wish to preserve. Default = NULL                                                                                                                                                  | c("output", "p1")                 |
| source    | logical argument, indicating whether to source the script before running the function. It is a necessary condition to run the script first so that objects appear in the environment. Default = FALSE. | FALSE                             |
| message   | logical argument, indicating whether to print a message or not. Default = TRUE                                                                                                                         | TRUE                              |

## `r (titlenb <- titlenb+1)`. Example

Here is an example. Note that the code below must be saved as a script. <br>

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, class.source='klippy'}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rosalieb/miscellaneous/master/R/get.objects.from.script.R")

# Create a bunch of objects
temp <- LETTERS[1:3]
data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1)
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

# List the objects in the current script
get.objects.from.script()

# Number of objects in the environment before the function:
length(ls()) # 158
# Remove all the objects in the script (as obtained by 
#   get.objects.from.script(), with the exception of "p1"
#   as specified by the argument 'exception = "p1"'.
rm(list = get.objects.from.script(exception = "p1",
                      message = FALSE))
# Number of objects in the environment after running the function
length(ls()) # 156 (we decided to keep "p1", so only two objects were removed)
```

Here is the what it looks like if you run it: <br>

<img src="images/Tuto7/Screenshot1.jpg" style="width:100%; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 5px" align="center"/>

It work well: with `get.objects.from.script()`, I do find the objects I just created. On the following line, I am able to remove these objects, but also include exception (e.g., if I want to keep "p1" for example.)

```{=html}
<script>
window.onscroll = function() {myFunction()};

var header = document.getElementById("myHeader");
var sticky = header.offsetTop;

function myFunction() {
  if (window.pageYOffset > sticky) {
    header.classList.add("sticky");
  } else {
    header.classList.remove("sticky");
  }
}
</script>
